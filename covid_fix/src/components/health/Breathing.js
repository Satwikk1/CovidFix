                                Deep breathing restores lung function by using the diaphragm. 
                                Breathing through the nose strengthens the diaphragm and encourages the nervous system to relax and restore itself.
                                When recovering from a respiratory illness like COVID-19, itâ€™s important not to rush recovery. 
                                This deep breathing exercise is broken up into phases to take into account individual ability. 
                                Start with Phase 1, and only increase repetitions or move to the next phase when you can complete the exercise without feeling too out of breath.

                                COVID patients tend to experience low oxygen levels which is why medical experts advise frequent monitoring of oxygen saturation. One can use a pulse oximeter for it. 
                                While proning helps improve oxygen levels, Dr Naresh Trehan, chairman, Medanta, also suggests practising yoga to keep lungs healthy. One of the pranayams he recommends is anulom viyom, adding that the pranayam is effective in expanding the lungs.

                                Fear, worry, and stress are normal responses to perceived or real threats, and at times when we are faced with uncertainty or the unknown. So it is normal and understandable that people are experiencing fear in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
                                Added to the fear of contracting the virus in a pandemic such as COVID-19 are the significant changes to our daily lives as our movements are restricted in support of efforts to contain and slow down the spread of the virus. Faced with new realities of working from home, temporary unemployment, home-schooling of children, and lack of physical contact with other family members, friends and colleagues, it is important that we look after our mental, as well as our physical, health. 
                                WHO, together with partners, is providing guidance and advice during the COVID-19 pandemic for health workers, managers of health facilities, people who are looking after children, older adults, people in isolation and members of the public more generally, to help us look after our mental health.

                                Proper nutrition and hydration are vital.
                                 People who eat a well-balanced diet tend to be healthier with stronger immune systems and lower risk of chronic illnesses and infectious diseases.
                                  So you should eat a variety of fresh and unprocessed foods every day to get the vitamins, minerals, dietary fibre, protein and antioxidants your body needs.
                                   Drink enough water. Avoid sugar, fat and salt to significantly lower your risk of overweight, obesity, heart disease, stroke, diabetes and certain types of cancer.
